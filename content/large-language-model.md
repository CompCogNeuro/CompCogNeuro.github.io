TODO: goals for this page: 

* hub of links and comparison with Axon, including main page on [[transformers]]

* future attempt to consolidate lessons learned from LLMS about fundamental issues in representation and dynamics in neural models required to exhibit systematic knowledge -- situate in context of systematicity in the brain paper: [[@^OReillyRanganathRussin22]].  Abstraction, combinatorial dynamics, shortcuts, role of key-value attention heads, etc.
