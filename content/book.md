## Computational Cognitive Neuroscience

This is an open and free textbook based on the [[Leabra]] framework, which has been published in various forms going back to [[@^OReillyMunakata00]]. See [[CCN Intro]] for a newer version based on the [[Axon]] framework which is a successor to Leabra, and forms the basis for all the other content on this website.

This book is available for download in a variety of formats:

* [PDF](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/book/releases/latest/download/ccnbook_ed5.pdf) --- This version has the best formatting.

* [ePub](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/book/releases/latest/download/ccnbook_ed5.epub) --- You can download this file and email it to yourself at your [Amazon Kindle account](https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email) to get it on your Kindle. You can also open it in the macOS Books app.

* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFWMZYWJ) --- You can pay to get the book on your Kindle or as a paperback version in color. These options are priced as low as possible.

* [HTML](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/book/releases/latest/download/ccnbook_ed5.html) --- This does not display all of the math correctly, so you should use one of the other formats above for Chapters 2 and 4.
