**Activation** and [[weights]] are the two most important concepts for [[abstract neural network]] models, where activations are dynamic state variables representing neural activity that are communicated to other neurons over weighted synaptic connections. In a standard [[rate-code activation]] model, a single real-valued (floating point) number is used for the activation value. Biological [[neuron]]s instead communicate via discrete _action potentials_ or _spikes_.
