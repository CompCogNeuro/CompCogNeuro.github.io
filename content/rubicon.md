**Rubicon** is a theory originally proposed by [[@^HeckhausenGollwitzer87]] that was independently developed and elaborated in [[@^OReillyHazyMollickEtAl14]] and [[@^OReilly20]], which forms the basis of a systems-neuroscience model of goal-driven learning and cognition, which has been a major focus of initial research using the [[Axon]] model.




The central premise of Rubicon is that _accomplishing desired outcomes (goals) requires a sustained focus of cognition and behavior over time._

This may sound obvious, but it has major implications, and is not widely deployed in current AI / machine learning [[reinforcement learning]] models, because it requires solving some of the most pressing unsolved problems in [[Computational Cognitive Neuroscience]] (in the opinion of the author at least).

One of the main such problems is:

* How can a system learn novel goal representations? How can you possibly synthesize a novel plan for something you've never done before? If you can't do that, then you can never do anything new!

There have been various proposals for solving this problem, which involve various forms of _chunking_ (combining basic action elements into new chunked elements, and so on; e.g., [[@SuttonPrecupSingh99]]; [[@AndersonLebiere98]]), and other heuristic, clustering-based approaches ([[@CollinsFrank13]]; [[@SchapiroRogersCordovaEtAl13]]).
