**Rubicon** is a theory originally developed by [@HeckhausenGolwitzer87] that has been elaborated in [@OReillyEtAl14] and [@OReilly21] and forms the basis of a systems-neuroscience model of goal-driven learning and cognition, which has been a major focus of initial research using the [[axon]] model.
