**Rubicon** is a theory originally developed by [[@^HeckhausenGollwitzer87]] and elaborated in [[@^OReillyHazyMollickEtAl14]] and [[@^OReilly20]], which forms the basis of a systems-neuroscience model of goal-driven learning and cognition, which has been a major focus of initial research using the [[axon]] model.
