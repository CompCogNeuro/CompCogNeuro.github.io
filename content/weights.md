**Weights** represent the effective strength of the _synapse__ connecting two [[neuron]]s in an [[abstract neural network]] framework. This is what changes during [[learning]], typically as a function of the [[activation]] of the neural units on either side of the synapse, the **sending, presynaptic** neuron and the **receiving, postsynaptic** neuron.
