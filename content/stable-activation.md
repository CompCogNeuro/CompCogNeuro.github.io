In the original Leabra rate-code neurons using FFFB inhibition, the continuous nature of the GABA-A type inhibition serves this function already, so these GABA-B channels have not been as important, but whenever a discrete spiking function has been used along with FFFB inhibition or direct interneuron inhibition, there is a strong tendency for every neuron to fire at some point, in a rolling fashion, because neurons that are initially inhibited during the first round of firing can just pop back up once that initial wave of associated GABA-A inhibition passes.  This is especially problematic for untrained networks where excitatory connections are not well differentiated, and neurons are receiving very similar levels of excitatory input.  In this case, learning does not have the ability to further differentiate the neurons, and does not work effectively.
