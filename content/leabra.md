**Leabra** stands for _local, error-driven and associative, biologically-realistic algorithm_, and was originally developed in [[@^OReilly96a]]. It is the basis for the [[book|Computational Cognitive Neuroscience]] textbook ([[@OReillyMunakataFrankEtAl12]]) and its predecessor ([[@OReillyMunakata00]]). Much of the content here is now based on [[Axon]] which uses discrete spiking instead of the [[rate-code activations]] used in Leabra. Otherwise, all of the same principles and motivations behind Leabra apply to Axon, which is the next logical progression of the overall effort to develop a computationally tractable and biologically accurate model of the mammalian brain.
