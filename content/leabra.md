**Leabra** stands for _local, error-driven and associative, biologically-realistic algorithm_, and was originally developed in [@OReilly96a]. It is the basis for the [[book|Computational-Cognitive-Neuroscience]] textbook [@OReillyMunakataFrankEtAl12] and its predecessor [@OReillyMunakata00]. Much of the content here is now based on [[axon]] which uses discrete spiking instead of the rate code signals used in Leabra.
