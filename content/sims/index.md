The simulation exercises that go with the book are available under this same organization in GitHub, in the [sims](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/sims) repository.

If you want more background information and the underlying code, the simulations are implemented with the Go version of the [emergent](https://github.com/emer/emergent) framework.
