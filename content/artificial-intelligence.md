**Artificial intellignce** (AI) has been used to describe a very wide range of different computational frameworks over the years, including symbolic reasoning systems developed from the 1950s to the 1990s, and the current [[abstract neural network]] models including [[large language models]] (LLMs).

The question of what "counts" as "intelligent" is tricky, because mostly we use humans as the only available point of reference, while also not wanting to be too directly tied to the quirks of our own particular brand of intelligence. The attempt to define a clear set of criteria for what counts as intelligent is notoriously difficult, with the Turing test providing an unsatisfyingly pragmatic approach: if we can't tell the difference between it and a human, it must be intelligent.

One productive distinction that is relatively clear, at least in principle, is between "narrow" vs. "general" forms of intelligence, with most of the "new AI" models being of the more narrow variety. For example, the _Deep Blue_ chess playing system created by IBM in 1997 was clearly very narrow, being exclusively designed to play chess. Most other game playing models have likewise been optimized for specific games, even when they also use domain-general learning mechanisms. Likewise, most other deep neural networks are only good at specific tasks, such as image recognition.

Thus, the new goal in AI is to accomplish artificial _general_ intelligence (AGI), where the system achieves something approaching a human level of generalized intelligence across a wide range of domains. Some would argue that LLMs have accomplished AGI, or are at least very close. However, the counter-argument is that they really don't have much "true" intelligence of their own, and instead they have just absorbed a significant amount of human intelligence as represented in the collective output of human writing that they have been trained on. Given the tremendous scope of what these models have been trained on, it is difficult to tell the difference between a mere "reshuffling" of the training material versus something that we would consider to be a sign of truly intelligent cognition.

## Axon general intelligence goals

Given that our goal with the [[Axon]] project is to capture human-level cognitive function, we are also therefore aiming to accomplish AGI of the specifically human variety. What follows is a brief overview of what this means for our approach.

TODO: combination of posterior cortical parallel processing and abstraction learning, along with self-programming adaptive sequential turing machine performance via bg / pfc goal-driven system. system 1 vs. 2 etc. copy from other writeups.

should probably go in a separate page.
