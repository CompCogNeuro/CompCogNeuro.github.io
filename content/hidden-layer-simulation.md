TODO: convert sim to axon; currently only available in Leabra:

Open the [err_driven_hidden](https://compcogneuro.org/sims/ch4/err_driven_hidden) simulation in [CCN Sims](https://compcogneuro.org/simulations) to explore full [[error-driven learning]] with a hidden layer, which can solve any input output mapping.
