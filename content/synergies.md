This page collects some of the functional -- biological synergies present in the [[Axon]] framework.

* [[bidirectional connections]] which are a prominent ane well-established property of the [[neocortex]], and play a critical functional role in both [[constraint satisfaction]] and [[error-driven learning]].

* The complementary and synergistic properties of the [[neuron channels#nmda]] and [[neuron channels#gaba-b]] channels are critical for the [[stable activation]] needed for learning and processing in spiking networks.
