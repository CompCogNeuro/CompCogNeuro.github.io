This page collects some of the functional -- biological synergies present in the [[Axon]] framework.

* [[bidirectional connectivity]] which is a prominent and well-established property of the [[neocortex]], and play a critical functional role in both [[constraint satisfaction]] and [[error-driven learning]].

* The complementary and synergistic properties of the [[neuron channels#NMDA]] and [[neuron channels#GABA-B]] channels are critical for the [[stable activation]] needed for learning and processing in spiking networks.
