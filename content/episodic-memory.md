**Episodic memory** is a cognitive term for the rapid learning about individual episodes of experience, which is widely thought to be supported by the specific neural properties of the [[hippocampus]]. It can be contrasted with [[semantic memory]], which involves learning that integrates across many different episodes of experience, rather than capturing the specific details of individual experiences.
