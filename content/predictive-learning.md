**Predictive learning** refers to a form of [[error driven learning]] where the error signals derive from **prediction errors**: errors in the ability to predict what will happen next. This form of learning has been explored by many researchers in many forms over the years, and is the primary driver of learning in the current generation of [[large language model]]s (LLMs) that power Chat GPT and related models, which demonstrate the key advantages of this form of learning. Specifically, predictive learning works with raw, _unlabled data_, because learning is driven simply by predicting what will happen next in a sequence of raw data.

In the LLM context, this is predicting the next word that occurs in a stream of text. The impressive power of these models derives directly from their ability to learn from vast collections of written material scraped from the internet, and this is only possible because of the use of predictive learning.

The same principle applies to the brain: we can learn a tremendous amount about our world simply by trying to predict what happens next.
