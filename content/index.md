# Computational Cognitive Neuroscience, 5th Edition

### Randall C. O'Reilly, Yuko Munakata, Michael J. Frank, Thomas E. Hazy, and Contributors

This is the 5th edition of the online, freely available textbook, providing a complete, self-contained introduction to the field of **Computational Cognitive Neuroscience**, where computer models of the brain are used to understand a wide range of cognitive functions, including perception, attention, learning, memory, motor control, executive function, and language.

The first part of this textbook develops a coherent set of computational and neural principles that capture the behavior of networks of interconnected neurons, and the second part applies these principles to understand the above-listed cognitive functions.
