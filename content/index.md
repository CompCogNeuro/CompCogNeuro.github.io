# Computational Cognitive Neuroscience, 5th Edition

### R. C. O'Reilly, Y. Munakata, M. J. Frank, T. E. Hazy, & Contributors

This is the 5th edition of the online, freely available textbook, providing a complete, self-contained introduction to the field of **Computational Cognitive Neuroscience**, where computer models of the brain are used to understand a wide range of cognitive functions, including perception, attention, motor control, learning, memory, language, and executive function.

The first part of this textbook develops a coherent set of computational and neural principles that capture the behavior of networks of interconnected neurons, and the second part applies these principles to understand the above-listed cognitive functions.

## Simulation Exercises

The simulation exercises that go with the book are available under this same organization in github, in the `sims` repository: [https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/sims](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/sims)

If you want more background information and to see the underlying code, the simulations are implemented with the Go / Python version of the *emergent* framework / toolkit: [https://github.com/emer/emergent](https://github.com/emer/emergent)
