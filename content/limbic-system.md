The **limbic system** is a "classical" neuroscience concept, starting with the work of Paul Broca (1878), regarding the function of a collection of interconnected brain areas, which are generally the _ventral_ and _medial_ elements of each anatomically-defined brain region. [[@^Papez37]] significantly advanced this concept, identifying the _Papez Circuit_ of interconnected areas and correctly hypothesizing that they are critical for _emotion_ and _motivation_.

The [[Rubicon]] model can be seen as a current update to these classical ideas, focusing on the activation and maintenance of goal states, guided by emotional and motivational signals. One notable aspect of the classical limbic system is the central role of the [[hippocampus]] in this circuit, although the precise function of this brain system was unclear at the time (the discussion in [[@Papez37]] is quite speculative). With the benefit of significant further research, we now know that the hippocampus is critical for [[episodic memory]], which might otherwise seem at odds with a central role in emotion and motivation. However, these two functions may indeed by synergistic, to the extent that we use our memory to guide future planning and goal-driven behavior, which is now a widely accepted idea, and is central to the function of the [[Rubicon]] model.
