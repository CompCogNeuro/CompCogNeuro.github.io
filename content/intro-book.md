## Computational Cognitive Neuroscience: An Introduction

A selected organization of the content here can be used as a textbook for teaching a course on [[computational cognitive neuroscience]], as a update to the CCN [[book]] that has been available online since 2012, and was originally published by MIT Press as [[@^OReillyMunakata00]], based on the [[Leabra]] framework.

You can read the following pages in order to obtain a sensible progression of information:

1. Overview of the field and approach: [[Computational Cognitive Neuroscience]].
2. Neurons and what they do: [[neuron]], [[neuron detector]], [[neuron simulation]], [[detector simulation]].
3. Networks of neurons: [[neocortex]], [[categorization]], [[bidirectional connectivity]], [[inhibition]].
4. Learning: [[synaptic plasticity]], [[temporal derivative]], [[kinase algorithm]], [[predictive learning]].
5. Brain structure
6. Perception
7. Memory
8. Reinforcement learning and basal ganglia
9. Prefrontal cortex and working memory
10. Language
