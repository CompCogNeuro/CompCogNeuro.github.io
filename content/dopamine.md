**Dopamine** is a [[neuromodulator]] that modulates learning throughout the brain. It is secreted primarily by two adjacent brain areas in the brainstem, the **ventral tegmental area (VTA)** and **substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)**. From a computational perspective, activity of these dopamine neurons closely matches the behavior of the [[TD]] algorithm, which computes the [[TD#reward prediction error]] (RPE; the difference between predicted and actual reward received).

From a biological perspective many different neural pathways converge on the VTA and SNc to drive the firing of dopamine neurons. The [[PVLV]] model provides a well-validated framework for understanding what each of these different pathways contribute, and is a core element of the broader [[Rubicon]] framework for goal-driven, motivated behavior.
