**In activo** is a neologism (made-up word) used to distinguish a scientific result obtained from the brain in an _awake behaving state_, versus the broader _in vivo_ term which specifies an intact living organism, but critically does _not_ distinguish between the anesthetized and awake, behaving states.

Many neuroscience results obtained _in vivo_ have failed to generalize to the _in activo_ state, so it is critical to make this distinction in understanding the relevance of a given finding to the actual neural mechanisms driving awake, behaving cognitive function, which is what we ultimately care about here.

Furthermore, many studies are done in the _in vitro_ preparation, using slices or cultures of neurons extracted from the brain and analyzed in a dish under a microscope, which enables much more detailed and sophisticated analyses of individual neural functions to be studied. However, these conditions are even further removed from the _in activo_ state, and thus are even more susceptible to a failure to generalize to that state.

There are a large number of neuromodulatory and systems-level connectivity differences between an awake, behaving brain and one that is under a state of anaesthesia. For example, in the anesthetized brain, neural activity in the [[neocortex]] is generally much more synchronous and there is typcically less overall activity. This has implications for the mechanisms of neural [[adaptation]] for example, because it turns out that ongoing neural activity in the awake, behaving state results in persistent synaptic depression, which otherwise has been widely discussed as an important functional property of different neuron types ([[@AbbottVarelaSenEtAl97]]). See the [[adaptation]] page and [[@^Borst10]] in particular for details.

The extent to which different neurons exhibit nonlinear patterns of _burst firing_ is also very different in the _in vivo_ vs. _in activo_ states (cites).

In general, as [[@^Borst10]] notes, the behavior of the awake brain tends to be more _linear_ overall, with less short-term plasticity and less bursting. This is the behavior that we capture in our [[Axon]] [[neuron]]s, which we verify through extensive larger-scale simulations produce the best overall computational results.
