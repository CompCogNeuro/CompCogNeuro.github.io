## Computational Cognitive Neuroscience, 5th Edition

### Randall C. O'Reilly, Yuko Munakata, Michael J. Frank, Thomas E. Hazy, and Contributors

This is the 5th edition of the online, freely available textbook, providing a complete, self-contained introduction to the field of **Computational Cognitive Neuroscience**, where computer models of the brain are used to understand a wide range of cognitive functions, including perception, attention, learning, memory, motor control, executive function, and language.

The first part of this textbook develops a coherent set of computational and neural principles that capture the behavior of networks of interconnected neurons, and the second part applies these principles to understand the cognitive functions listed above.

For more information, see the pages for the [[book]] and [[simulations]].

## Axon and Rubicon simulations and documentation

This site hosts a growing library of interactive documentation and simulations based on the [[axon]] framework, which is the successor to the [[leabra]] framework used in the above textbook. Axon features discrete spiking instead of the rate code activations used in [[leabra]], and supports a systems-neuroscience model of goal-driven learning and cognition, named [[rubicon]].
