The **thalamus** plays essential roles in multiple different brain circuits, and is thus discussed in the context of those other circuits. Thus, this page is just a brief overview with pointers to those other pages.

From an evolutionary, comparative perspective, the thalamus consistently provides interconnectivity between primary sensory areas and the _pallium_, which is the outer-most region of the brain, i.e., the _telecephelon_. In mammals, the [[neocortex]] is a major component of the pallium, while other vertibrates have smaller, simpler cortex-like structures in their pallium that play the same functional role as the neocortex ([[Butler08]]). The functions highlighted below are specific to mammals.

* In posterior [[neocortex]], the _pulvinar_ nucleus of the thalamus supports [[predictive learning]] by alternatively representing a top-down prediction and a bottom-up outcome.

* There are multiple different thalamic nuclei interconnected with frontal [[neocortex]], particularly [[prefrontal cortex]] and the [[basal ganglia]], which play critical roles in goal-driven behavior as captured in the [[Rubicon]] model.
