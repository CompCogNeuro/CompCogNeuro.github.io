**Axon** is the successor to [[leabra]], featuring more realistic discrete spiking dynamics and more advanced brain area models to implement a highly functional version of the [[rubicon]] goal-driven learning system, based on the interactions of a large number of "limbic" brain areas.

Axon is used for all of the newer content here on CompCogNeuro.
