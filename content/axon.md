**Axon** is the successor to [[leabra]], featuring more realistic discrete spiking dynamics and associated learning mechanisms and more advanced brain area models to implement a functional version of the [[Rubicon]] goal-driven learning system, based on the interactions of a large number of "limbic" brain areas. Axon is used for all of the newer content here on CompCogNeuro.
