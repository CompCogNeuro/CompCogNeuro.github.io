**Reinforcement learning (RL)** is the widely-used term for more abstract, machine-learning and [[abstract neural network]] models that learn based on _trial and error_ exploration and reward / punishment signals. The [[Rubicon]] framework provides a biologically-detailed implementation of RL-level functionality in the context of the [[Axon]] model. In contrast to the focus of most abstract RL models, [[Rubicon]] emphasizes the roles of goals and high-dimensional internal motivational states, as compared to purely externally-driven scalar reward signals.
