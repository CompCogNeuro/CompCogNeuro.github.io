**ACh** is the abbreviation for **acetylcholine**, which is an important neuromodulator throughout the brain, and it plays an important role in the [[Rubicon]] goal-driven model, along with [[dopamine]]. The basic distinction between these two neuromodulators is that dopamine reflects a reward prediction error (RPE), with the emphasis on _error_, i.e., relative to a prediction, whereas ACh is more of a _raw_ reward signal without the error-signaling component, and it also fires robustly to novel, unexpected stimuli.

In the Rubicon framework, ACh is critical for modulating the excitability and learning of circuits that should only be engaged at the time of goal selection, and then again at the goal outcome, but _not_ in between. Consistent with this function, ACh fires for CSs that signal future rewards, and for USs that are the rewards themselves. Thus, the onset of a CS provides a goal-selection opportunity, and the corresponding ACh activation then makes the goal-selection circuitry more excitable, so that it can actually fire and engage a goal. Once a goal is engaged, it inhibits the activity of ACh, so the system does not get too distracted during goal pursuit.

Unlike dopamine which is released by two anatomically localized nuclei in the midbrain, there are a number of different ACh release sites throughout the brain, including in the [[basal ganglia]]. However, it appears that most of these different sites are coordinated together via the activity of two midbrain nuclei: the  laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) and the pedunculopontine (PPN) nucleus ([[@Huerta-OcampoDautanGutEtAl21]]). Thus, from a computational perspective, we can treat them as one coordinated signal, at least as a starting point.
