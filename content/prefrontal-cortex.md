The **prefrontal cortex** (PFC) is a key co-conspirator with the [[basal ganglia]] in guiding much of an organism's overall behavior. It is anatomically the anterior portion of the **frontal** [[neocortex]], where the posterior frontal cortex has secondary and primary motor areas with neurons that project down to the spinal cord and can directly drive motor actions. The most obvious function of the PFC is to provide direct "top-down" projections to these motor frontal areas, to guide behavior at a "higher level", which is often labeled **executive function**, similar to an executive in a company ([[@MillerCohen01]])

![Distributed goal representations across different prefrontal cortex (PFC) areas, each with associated areas of the striatum of the basal ganglia. The mediodorsal (MD) thalamus provides a common point of disinhibitory gating control, by which phasic updating of the PFC goal state can be controlled at the point of goal selection and after the goal outcome. OFC = orbitofrontal cortex; IL = infralimbic; ACC = anterior cingulate cortex; PL = prelimbic; dlPFC = dorsolateral PFC (isomorphic to ALM = anteriolateral motor cortex in rodents).](media/fig_rubicon_loops_spiral_goals.png)

The [[Rubicon]] goal-driven framework distinguishes three different regions of PFC that together comprise a distributed representation of a behavioral goal, as shown in [[#figure_goal-bio]]:

* **OFC (orbitofrontal cortex)** and **IL (infralimbic cortex)** are ventral and medial PFC areas that represent motivationally-salient outcomes at different levels of abstraction, which we denote as USs (unconditioned stimuli) in the standard conditioning terminology. These are the things that you are trying to get when you engage in goal-driven behavior: food, water, praise, etc.

* **ACC (anterior cingulate cortex)** and **PL (prelimbic cortex)** are dorsomedial (ACC) and anterior-medial (PL) PFC areas that represent the _costs_ associated with accomplishing a goal (effort, risk, uncertainty, in the ACC), and the net benefit vs. cost _utility_ associated with accomplishing the goal (in PL). Thus, PL is the single most important integrative area for goal-driven behavior, providing the net estimated value of actually taking on a given goal.

* **dlPFC (dorsolateral PFC)** (which is **ALM (anterior-lateral motor)** in rodents) represents high-level action plans that are necessary to obtain the goal. It projects extensively to the ACC to drive the cost etc estimates associated with these plans, and once a goal is selected and engaged, it provides a top-down bias on action representations in the SMA (supplementary motor area), which includes premotor cortex in this broad conception. These higher-level action areas likewise drive individual motor action representations in primary motor areas.

Thus, across these different PFC areas, all of the essential pieces of information necessary to evaluate and execute goals is encoded. Furthermore, the PFC contains special excitatory recurrent connectivity patterns and specialized types of [[neuron channels#NMDA]] channels that enable **sustained neural firing** of this information over time, in order to maintain focus on the current goal. This sustained neural firing is also known as **working memory** or delay activity, as originally described when discovered in monkey PFC recordings ([[@FusterAlexander71]]; [[@KubotaNiki71]]; [[@FunahashiBruceGoldman-Rakic89]]).

As also shown in [[#figure_goal-bio]], each PFC area is extensively interconnected with corresponding areas in the [[basal ganglia]] (BG) and different regions of the thalamus, which form multiple parallel loops ([[@AlexanderDeLongStrick86]]; [[@FosterBarryKorobkovaEtAl21]]) that also have an overall _spiraling_ pattern such that the ventral-medial OFC, IL, PL, and ACC areas asymmetrically project to areas that interact with dlPFC and motor areas, but not the other way around, as shown in the figure ([[@HaberFudgeMcFarland00]]).

The functional role of these BG and thalamic connections has been a matter of considerable debate, but recent neuroscience data ([[@GuoYamawakiSvobodaEtAl18]]) is converging with earlier computational ideas ([[@FrankLoughryOReilly01]]; [[@OReillyFrank06]]) to support the idea that the BG can **gate** or toggle the sustained neural firing in PFC. However, this gating function is likely only associated with the initial goal-selection process, taking place across the ventral / medial PFC areas listed above, while the dorsolateral BG areas that interconnect with the frontal motor areas provide a modulatory learning signal that can drive learning in the cortex based on initial acquisition in the BG.

In the remaining sections, we discuss each of these major issues in turn, starting with the functional organization of PFC in relation to the BG and thalamus, then turning to neural mechanisms supporting sustained neural firing, and finally reviewing recent evidence on the relationship between the BG and PFC. 

## Functional organization of PFC

![Functional anatomy of the prefrontal cortex in the primate brain, focusing on medial and ventral areas, based on data from Ongur & Price. The top is dorsal, which moves down to ventral at the center of the figure, and it then "splays out" to the ventrolateral regions at the bottom. As emphasized by Ongur & Price, strong subcortical projections drive the organization of these areas, as labeled in the figure. As is true of anything in the neocortex, none of this is crisp and modular, but considerable evidence supports the overall characterizations.](media/fig_rubicon_anatomy_macaque.png)

[[#figure_pfc-fun]] provides an elaborated version of the prior figure, mapped onto the medial and ventral areas of the primate brain, using functional data based on the connectivity with subcortical areas described by [[@^OngurPrice00]].

### PL

[[@FriedmanHommaGibbEtAl15]] test cost-benefit conflicts in rats, find selective effects in PL and projection to striosomes in [[basal ganglia]]. Also show that ACC encodes cost information and projects more to matrix.
