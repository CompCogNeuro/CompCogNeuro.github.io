Synaptic plasticity is the well-established biological phenomenon that synaptic weights change in strength, which is known to be the primary basis for **learning** in the brain, consistent with the foundational hypothesis of **connectionism** / **neural network models**: _knowledge is encoded in synaptic weights_.

* **LTP = long-term potentiation** refers to _increases_ in synaptic strength, as initially established by [@BlissLomo73].

* **LTD = long-term depression** refers to _decreases_ in synaptic strength, which took a while longer to establish [@BearMalenka94].
