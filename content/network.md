The web of interconnected [[neuron]]s in the brain is known as a **network**, and there are a number of important [[computational cognitive neuroscience#emergent phenomena]] that arise in these networks, associated with different patterns of connectivity present in the [[neocortex]].

The _feedforward_ flow of neural activity from lower layers of neurons that are closer to the sensory inputs up to higher layers can be understood in terms of [[categorization]], where detailed sensory patterns are systematically transformed into more abstract categories that provide a more efficient [[linear algebra|basis]] for behavior.

Thus, the network level of analysis is focused on the nature of _representations_, i.e., the properties of the patterns of neuron firing in a given area of the network. [[Distributed representations]] are critical for efficient encoding of high-dimensional information, as elaborated in the discussion of [[combinatorial-vs-conjunctive]] encodings. These different types of representations have important implications for [[generalization]] performance: how well the system can process novel inputs and situations.

[[Bidirectional connectivity]] enables additional emergent phenomena to arise, including [[attractor dynamics]] (e.g., top-down imagery and ambiguity resolution), and multiple [[constraint satisfaction]], which involves finding a representation that best satisfies constraints from the current inputs and prior learned knowledge encoded in synaptic weights. The constraint satisfaction process is an efficient, parallel form of [[search]] through representational space, providing [[optimized representations]] relative to purely feedforward activation flow.

Bidirectional excitatory connectivity requires [[inhibition]] to control the potential runaway positive feedback loops, consistent with the extensive networks of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex. Inhibition is also beneficial for imposing a form of competition between different representations, which is an essential feature of [[attention]].
