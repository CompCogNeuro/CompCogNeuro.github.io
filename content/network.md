The web of interconnected [[neuron]]s in the brain is known as a **network**, and there are a number of important [[computational cognitive neuroscience#emergent phenomena]] that arise in these networks, associated with different patterns of connectivity.

The _feedforward_ flow of neural activity from lower layers of neurons that are closer to the sensory inputs up to higher layers can be understood in terms of [[categorization]].  Also [[distributed representations]] and [[combinatorial-vs-conjunctive]].

[[Bidirectional connectivity]] enables additional emergent phenomena to arise, including attractor dynamics, [[constraint satisfaction]], [[optimized representations]].

Bidirectional connectivity also requires [[inhibition]] to control runaway positive feedback loops.
